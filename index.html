    <h1 style> Welcome to my Multimedia Project... </h1> 
    <p> In this timeline exploration, I will cover the theme of love and its evolution throughout literary history from the Old English Period to the 18th Century. I'll be highlighting a few of my favorite works from each period and will take a closer look at how love is portrayed adn what themes love interplays with. I will also pinpoint lines that offer insights into how love was depicted, perceived, and entwined with the social structure of each era.</p>
