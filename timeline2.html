    <p> <h1> “Sir Orfeo” by Unknown</h1>
This poem is really sweet and was one of my favorite works we covered. It is about the story of Orfeo, a king who willingly leaves his royal status behind to find his missing wife. In lines 177 to 178, he says, "Lever me were to lete mi liif than thus to lese the quen, mi wiif!" When translated, Sir Orfeo is saying that he would rather die than live without his wife (the queen). That is some serious commitment to the person you love! In lines 209 to 211, he also declares, "For now ichave mi quen y-lore, The fairest levedi that ever was bore, Never eft y nil no woman se." Here, he pledges loyalty to his beautiful wife and vows never to be with another woman. Within the context of Middle English culture, I think loyalty to your lover, in this story, refers to both placing the lover above everything else (loyalty) and not committing infidelity (being honorable to the one you love). I think this narrative shows a shift where love is becoming a more prominent theme in storytelling while, at the same time, becoming intertwined with other themes like honor, loyalty, and heroism that are very important in this time period.

    <p> <h1> “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” by Unknown </h1>
"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" is a tale about Gawain, a knight who is on a noble quest where he must honorably repay a debt, even if it means losing his head. The story revolves around themes of honor, adventure, and courtly love. We see these interplay in lines 1520-1524, where Bertilak's Wife, a married woman, says, "you the most notable of all noble knights...yet you have not spoken the smallest syllable which belongs to love or anything like it." Here, it almost seems like Bertilak's Wife is bringing Gawain's honor as a knight into question because it is a knight's duty/honor to treat women with courtesy and respect. Also, Bertilak's wife is above Gawain in social class, so a member of the lower social class rejecting a member of the higher social class wasn't very common in the Middle Ages. Gawain returning romantic affection to the wife of a man who invited him into his house also challenges Gawain's moral code. Gawain, choosing to stand his ground and reject Bertilak's wife's advances (besides accepting the gift to save his own life), gives the readers a look into the complex interplay of Middle English social-class customs and chivalry towards women.

    <p> <h1> “The Wife of Bath's Tale” by Geoffrey Chaucer </h1>
In this story, the main character is a terrible human and, to save himself from being executed, he is forced to marry an old hag(who he really dislikes because he thinks she is ugly). Towards the ending of the poem, when his wife asks him if he would rather her be faithful and ugly or unfaithful and disloyal to him. In the lines 406-411, he says, “My lady and my love, my dearest wife, I leave the matter to your wise decision. You make the choice yourself, for the provision Of what may be agreeable and rich In honor to us both, I don’t care which; Whatever pleases you suffices me.” This is the start of a change within the main character. In return for him giving up control over her, she becomes the perfect woman for him, both loyal and beautiful. To me, this suggests that she did desire power, but after being given control of her own future, love is what she truly desires. This is an interesting twist on the courtly love tradition especially considering that, in this story, the woman is below the main character's social class, is not “beautiful,” and, in the beginning, the main character, the knight, has no desire to marry the woman. This is a fun twist on the genre and a completely different look on love and loyalty.
