    <p> <h1> “The long love that in my thoughts doth harbor” by Thomas Wyatt </h1>
This poem explores how love shows itself on the narrator. In lines 3-4, the phrase "Into my face presseth with bold pretense, And there campeth, displaying his (love) banner," vividly illustrates blushing, and how, with context from the rest of the poem, despite facing rejection, the mark caused by unreciprocated feelings lingers. Towards the end of the poem, in line 11 it says, “And there him (love) hideth and not appeareth,” so, to me, it appears that the woman who rejected the narrator has led him to abandon the pursuit of love altogether (or maybe abandone pursuit of love that is not hers). The theme of loneliness reminds me of "The Wife's Lament" from the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem's concluding line, "for good is the life ending faithfully," also adds a layer to the theme of love. It brings about the idea of unwavering loyalty, and in this context, I think it talks about maintaining honor through rejection. This means dedicating your life to someone who may not reciprocate your feelings (which is a theme that also appears in the next example!)

    <p> <h1> “Astrophel and Stella 1” by Phillip Sydney </h1>
"Astrophel and Stella'' is a collection of sonnets. In the first stanza of the first sonnet of this collection, it says, "Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That the dear She might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain," The narrator, Astrophel, is trying to make the woman, Stella, have pity on him through writing poems (which often have very graphic imagery). He also places great importance on impressing her with his sonnets, but often, I feel as if he goes too far. There are a lot of very beautifully written poems in this collection, for example, there is one where he compares her to the stars...and then there is a sonnet about him fantasizing about being her dog and licking her. It was a...interesting read. To me, it is almost obsessive and a little creepy. In this collection we see themes of loneliness and unrequited love again. I think the main takeaway is that the narrator is so desperate for her unrequited attention, that he is basically manipulating her with sympathy to get into a relationship with him. Both examples of text that I chose show love as being something very heavily desired, but also unrequited.

    <p> <h1> “To His Coy Mistress” by Andrew Marvell </h1>
This is my favorite poem. It has a lot of graphic imagery and, once again, a narrator begging for a woman's attention and love. There is a really interesting tone shift throughout the poem. It goes from sweet, to desperate, to aggressive, and the line, "then worms shall try; That long preserved virginity," is such a disgusting and vivid use of imagery. It seems like there were a lot of "seduction" poems wrote in this time period, and I think it could be applicable to a man lusting after a woman today. The line, And while thy willing soul transpires, At every pore with instant fires, Now let us sport us while we may, And now, like amorous birds of prey," to me, seems as if the man is directly asking the woman for sex. It is a lot less respectful towards the woman, which is an interesting narrative shift that I haven't really seen up to this point.
