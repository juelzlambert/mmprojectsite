    <p> <h1> “The Wife's Lament” by Unknown</h1>
This poem is about the  heartbreak, betrayal, and loneliness of a woman who was exiled from her lover. In the poem, the woman narrator talks about how she faced exile and separation from her husband by his kinsmen, so I believe it may be a possibility that the woman was diplomatically married. Lines 32-35 (of the translated version) also talk about how she expresses a profound yearning for love and companionship when it says, "Here my lord's leaving often fiercely seized me. There are friends on earth, lovers living who lie in their bed, while I walk alone in the light of dawn.” This poem highlights how hard it is to deal with the ache of separation when you cannot be around someone you love for reasons out of your control. It also highlights the very human need for romantic connection and a partner. I think this poem is a good example of how loneliness/heartbreak, as we will come to see, has always been a prevalent topic in historical literacy.

    <p> <h1> “Beowulf” by Unknown </h1>
While the main themes of “Beowulf” do not revolve around love, there is a small section about familial love in the story. After Grendal's arm is torn off in battle, he returns home and succumbs to death. His mother, when she finds him dead, is consumed by grief and vengeance. This can be seen in lines 1333 to 1344 of the translated version of "Beowulf" where it says: "She has taken up the feud Because of last night, when you killed Grendel….Other one arrives, this force for evil Driven to avenge her kinsman’s death.Or so it seems to thanes in their grief..." I think "love" in this poem is not romantic love, however it is familial love between a mother and her son. It also ties back to the themes of isolation and loneliness. I think this poem is a good example of how love and loyalty are very interlinked within Old English society.
