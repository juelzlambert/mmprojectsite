  <h1 style>Common Themes and Findings</h1>
    <p> Across Old English to the 18th century, love and themes that interplay with it have evolved. In the Old English period, we saw themes involving loyalty and loneliness. Transitioning to the Middle English period, love became more prominent and entwined with honor and also carried over the theme of loyalty. We also got to see how chivalry interacted with courtly love and covered a story that challenged norms within courtly love writing. We also saw power dynamics and how that impacted relationships. After that, we began to see the theme of loneliness pop up again alongside desperation for attention from an unrequited love. The 18th century was very different, but also offered very thought-provoking portrayals of love. Here we saw true love portrayed as rare and overshadowed by reputation and the need for success. Collectively, these poems all offered a unique perspective on the subject and all can be connected back to each other somehow. To me, it is really interesting to see how themes surrounding love, even dating back to works with unknown authors, are still prevalent today.
