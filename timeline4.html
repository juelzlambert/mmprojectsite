    <p> <h1> “The Vanity of Human Wishes” by Samuel Johnson</h1>
This free-verse poem mostly talks about themes of ambition and maintaining moral integrity. The poem does not mention or focus on the theme of love that often, but the few things it does have to say about love is thought-provoking. One instance where love is mentioned is found in line 19 of stanza 17, where it states, "For love, which scarce collective man can fill." In this line, love seems to be portrayed as a rare and kind of hard-to-find concept. In line 7 of stanza eight, love is mentioned again when it says, "Love ends with hope, the sinking statesman’s door." Here, this line suggests to me that love may only be found when there is value. If there is no hope for monetary gain or furthering success, there is no love. It is almost like if it hinders success, love is not deemed valuable. It seems, in this poem specifically, like love is being replaced by the idea of personal gain which is not a concept I have seen in the other poems listed.

    <p> <h1> “The Rape of the Lock” by Alexander Pope </h1>
This poem intrigued me but it was very challenging to read and understand. To my understanding, it appears that this poem mocks the artificiality and shallowness of high-society women and men (with an emphasis on the main character Belinda). It has themes of honor and vanity. In lines 175-176 of canto 5, the poemsays, "Oh hadst thou, Cruel! Been content to seize Hairs less in sight, or any Hairs but these!" I think Belinda putting so much stress on the baron cutting off visible hair might suggest that she dislikes the baron pursuing her publicly because it is damaging reputation which is damaging to her beauty. I have to admit, it is a stretch, but either way, it's evident that the baron has wronged Belinda in his pursuit of romance with her. This poem was really interesting to me and I wanted to include it because it seems to satirize high society and the fakeness of love in high society social groups. This poem has a lot of interplay between love and societal norms.
